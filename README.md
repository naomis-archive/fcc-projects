# freeCodeCamp Projects

These are the projects I submitted to obtain my freeCodeCamp certifications during the beginning of my development journey. Many of these projects are significantly outdated, but have been preserved in their unmodified form for posterity.

NOTE: Pull Requests are not accepted to this repository. These projects are being [migrated to a new version](https://github.com/nhcarrigan/freecodecamp-projects), which is where you should make contributions.
